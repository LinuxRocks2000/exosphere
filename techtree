this is the initially planned tech/upgrade tree.
"tech" is just manufacturing capabilities on the fabber bays. each fabber bay can be upgraded to provide more powers. your initial castle has the most powerful fabber bay
which can build anything; your forts, outposts, and farms have weaker fabber bays. The things that you can make are in this tree:

[Missiles] Characterized by moving fast and uncoordinatedly, usually as kinetic weapons but sometimes with an explosive payload. They do not fire bullets. $700/level.
* Kinetic Missile <base type>: upgraded bullet, basically. Follows a course until it hits something, and does impact damage to it. $5. Level 1.
* Seeking Missile: missile that follows a course until it notices an enemy ship in range, which it peels off and kinetic-strikes. $10. Level 1.
* Hypersonic Missile: missile with a small explosive payload. Detonates on impact. $20. Level 2.
* Plasma Rocket: missile that fires a short-range laser out the front, allowing it to drill through rubble and do extra damage to things it hits. $25. Level 3.
* Cruise Missile: Larger, slower hypersonic missile with a larger explosion radius. $50. Level 4.

[Ships] Ships move slower than missiles but are more coordinated. They fire bullets intermittently. $600/level.
* Fighter <base type>: Small, somewhat-slow ship that fires one minor bullet per 30 play ticks. $10. Level 1.
* Tie Fighter: Larger ship that moves at the same speed as a Fighter. Has a repeater weapon - fires minor bullets in a 25-5 repeater pattern. Slightly better range. $20. Level 1.
* Sniper: Small, fast ship that fires one long-range bullet every 120 ticks. $30. Level 1.
* Gunship: Small ship at the same speed as a Fighter. Fires minor bullets in a 25-5 repeater pattern, but aimed with the turret algorithm. Will not fire
    without enemies in range; will friendly-fire. $60. Level 2.
* Demolition Cruiser: Large, slow ship that fires a huge, long-range explosive bullet every 120 ticks. $60. Level 2.

[Economic] "Farm tools". $50/level.
* Seed: grows into a chest when inside a farm-field. $5. Level 1.
* Farmhouse: Projects a "farm field" - a 200 unit radius that matures seeds into chests. Actually a building, but more convenient under this category. $70. Level 2.
* Scrap ship: Not technically a ship as it does not fire bullets. Uses a laser to mine nearby chests, but will not fire if the laser would hit a friendly. $20. Level 2.

[Defense] Defensive pieces are designed to prevent enemies from succesfully infiltrating your territory. Most defenses are closer to buildings than to ships,
            but they're small and simple and can be placed by a fabber. $200/level.
* Laser Node: Laser nodes near each other fire high-energy lasers between them, creating a nearly impassible gate. Large swarms can effectively overwhelm them, though.
                Laser nodes also fire lasers with a very short range at enemy objects near them, making them difficult to fight with bullets (although explosives
                are still effective). $20 each. Level 1.
* Basic Turret: Aims with the low-fidelity turret algorithm (can hit slow-moving or large objects), fires a minor bullet every 20 play ticks. $50. Level 1.
* Laser Node Long Range: Three times the range of a usual laser node. Useful for covering holes without providing a weak point. Will connect at short range to normal laser nodes.
                          $80. Level 2.
* Smart Turret: Aims with the high-fidelity turret algorithm and fires a minor bullet every 20 play ticks. $100. Level 2.
* Blast Turret: Aims with the high-fidelity turret algorithm and fires an explosive bullet every 30 play ticks. $150. Level 3.
* Laser Turret: Fires a high-energy laser into any nearby enemy piece. $250. Level 3.

[Buildings] Buildings are complex structures that are difficult or impossible to shift out of position. They can't be built by a fabber; they have to be
                fabbed by a specialized constructor ship. $800/level.
**** Constructor Ships are "ships" that follow a course until (at any time during play or move ships) the player orders construction to begin, in which case they are
    fixed and vulnerable for 1800 play-ticks (a standard play period is 40 seconds, or 1200 play-ticks). At the end of that period, they are fully deleted and the
    object they were constructing is put in their place. Pure constructor ships cannot be placed by the player; they have to place one of the variants below. ****
* Outpost Constructor: Constructor ship that yields an outpost. Outposts are the weakest building - they provide a Small-M0S0E2D1B0 fabber, and nothing else
                        (like any other fabber, outpost fabbers can be upgraded, but it ain't cheap). $300. Level 1.
* Teleportal Constructor: Constructor ship that places a teleportal pair. Teleportal pairs instantly transport materiel over long distances. The constructor ship has to be
                            moved to the *first* teleportal location, constructed (which takes half the time of normal constructor ship operation), and then constructed at
                            the second location. Enemy ships can also use teleportals, so defenses are necessary: outposts are good for this. $600. Level 1.
* Fort Constructor: Yields a fort, which starts with a Medium-M2S1E2D2B1 fabber. $800. Level 2.
* Castle Constructor: Yields a castle, which starts with a Large-M4S2E2D3B2 fabber. $3000. Level 3.


Fabber levels decide what sections on the tech tree a fabber can build. Each fabber has a constant range and a level for each branch on the tree. All values can be upgraded.
A fabber can fab or repair a piece if the level of the piece is equal to or less than the fabber level in that tech line; upgrades to the pieces do not change their level.
Fabber levels cost a constant for each tech line times the level. For instance, missiles, which are very high-yield weapons, require more expensive fabbers at $700 a level,
but economic fabber upgrades only costs $50 a level. Fabber specifications are represented as a size (one of [Large, Medium, Small]) and initials + level for each tech
section. For instance, outposts have a Small-M0S0E2D1B0 fabber by default.

Aside from providing better fabbers, castles and forts and outposts produce *territory*. The only effect this produces is subtle: non-allied territories can never overlap.
This means that expansion is bottlenecked; you eventually have to destroy enemy bases to take more territory. Castles produce significantly more territory than forts,
and outposts do not produce territory. It is possible to place in enemy territory if you have a fabber that extends into it.
