# Exosphere

Exosphere is the third member of Tyler Clarke's Strategy Game franchise. It is a direct successor to MMOSG v2, but with more realistic physics and smoother gameplay.
Unlike MMOSG v2, which is written with a custom websocket server, game engine, and physics engine, Exosphere uses the open source Bevy, Warp, and Rapier libraries.

update 2025-8-14: exosphere no longer uses warp or rapier; I've replaced warp with custom network and rapier with avian2d

Exosphere is free software under GNU GPLv3.

HOW TO RUN:
To run the server, enter the `server/` directory and just `cargo run --release`. It'll host websocket on localhost:3000.

To run the client, enter the `client/` directory and `wasm-pack build --target web`. You'll need wasm-pack; you can get that with `cargo install wasm-pack`.
That will compile the WASM objects and glue. Once that's done, start any http server in `client/` and visit it locally.
