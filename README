# Exosphere

Exosphere is the third member of Tyler Clarke's Strategy Game franchise. It is a direct successor to MMOSG v2, but with more realistic physics and smoother gameplay.
Unlike MMOSG v2, which is written with a custom websocket server, game engine, and physics engine, Exosphere uses the open source Bevy, Warp, and Rapier libraries.

Exosphere is free software under GNU GPLv3.
